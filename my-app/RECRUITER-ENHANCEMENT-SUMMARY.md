## ⏳ IN-PROGRESS / PLACEHOLDER FEATURES

### 1. **State Management (Frontend Only)** ⚠️
Currently tracked in React state (lost on page refresh):
- Contacted students list
- Favorite students set
- Pipeline stages per student

**Status:** Works in current session but needs database persistence

### 2. **Analytics Calculations** ⚠️
Currently showing placeholder values:
```typescript
contacted_students: 0,
engagement_rate: 0,
response_rate: 0
```

**Status:** Structure ready, needs actual calculation logic

### 3. **PDF Export** ⚠️
Button exists but shows placeholder:
```typescript
console.log('Exporting students:', selectedStudents);
// TODO: Implement PDF generation
```

**Status:** UI ready, needs implementation

---

## 🚧 NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Database Persistence Tables** ❌

Need to create these Supabase tables:

```sql
-- Track recruiter favorites
CREATE TABLE recruiter_favorites (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  recruiter_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  student_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(recruiter_id, student_id)
);

-- Track pipeline stages
CREATE TABLE recruiter_pipeline (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  recruiter_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  student_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  stage TEXT CHECK (stage IN ('shortlisted', 'contacted', 'interviewed', 'offered', 'rejected')),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(recruiter_id, student_id)
);

-- Track contact history
CREATE TABLE recruiter_contacts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  recruiter_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  student_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  contacted_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  method TEXT, -- 'email', 'phone', 'linkedin'
  notes TEXT,
  response_received BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  response_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE recruiter_favorites ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE recruiter_pipeline ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE recruiter_contacts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies (recruiters can only see their own data)
CREATE POLICY "Recruiters can manage their favorites" ON recruiter_favorites
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = recruiter_id);

CREATE POLICY "Recruiters can manage their pipeline" ON recruiter_pipeline
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = recruiter_id);

CREATE POLICY "Recruiters can manage their contacts" ON recruiter_contacts
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = recruiter_id);
```

### 2. **Backend API Endpoints** ❌

Need to create:
- `POST /api/recruiter/favorites` - Add/remove favorites
- `PUT /api/recruiter/pipeline` - Update pipeline stage
- `POST /api/recruiter/contact` - Log contact event
- `GET /api/recruiter/history` - Get recruitment history

### 3. **Real Analytics Calculation** ❌

Need to implement:
```typescript
// Calculate from recruiter_contacts table
const contacted_students = await countContacted(recruiter_id);

// Calculate from recruiter_contacts where response_received = true
const engagement_rate = (responded / contacted) * 100;

// Calculate from recruiter_pipeline where stage changed
const response_rate = (replies / sent_emails) * 100;
```

### 4. **PDF Export Functionality** ❌

Need to implement using libraries like:
- `jsPDF` - Generate PDF documents
- `html2canvas` - Convert student cards to images
- Or use backend PDF generation with `puppeteer`

### 5. **Advanced Features** ❌

**Email Integration:**
- Currently opens mailto: link
- Could integrate with Gmail API, Outlook API
- Track email open rates, click rates

**Calendar Integration:**
- Schedule interviews

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### **Phase 1: Database Persistence (CRITICAL)** 🔴
1. Create three tables (favorites, pipeline, contacts)
2. Implement save/load API endpoints
3. Update frontend to persist actions
**Why:** Currently all actions lost on refresh

### **Phase 2: Real Analytics (HIGH)** 🟡
1. Calculate actual contacted count
2. Calculate engagement rate from responses
3. Calculate response rate from replies
**Why:** Currently showing 0 for everything

### **Phase 3: Contact Tracking (MEDIUM)** 🟢
1. Auto-log when "Contact" button clicked
2. Track email sent timestamp
3. Manually mark when response received
**Why:** Enables accurate metrics

### **Phase 4: PDF Export (LOW)** ⚪
1. Choose PDF library (jsPDF recommended)
2. Design PDF template
3. Implement export functionality
**Why:** Nice-to-have feature

### **Phase 5: Advanced Features (FUTURE)** ⚫
- Email API integration
- Calendar scheduling
- Notes & ratings
- Custom tags
- Activity timeline
**Why:** Enhance recruiter experience

## 📝 SUMMARY

### **What Works Now:**
✅ Professional recruiter-focused UI/UX
✅ Real student data loading (no dummy data)
✅ Search & filter functionality
✅ Student detail pages with full info
✅ Verification details with confidence scores
✅ Contact via email (mailto)
✅ Pipeline dropdown (state only)
✅ Favorites toggle (state only)

### **What Needs Work:**
⏳ Database persistence (critical)
⏳ Real analytics calculations
⏳ PDF export implementation
⏳ Contact history tracking
⏳ Advanced features (email integration, notes, etc.)

### **Current State:**
🟢 **Fully functional for single-session use**
🟡 **Loses data on page refresh**
🔴 **Needs database tables for production**

The recruiter dashboard is **80% complete** for UI/UX and basic functionality, but needs database persistence to be production-ready!

---

Would you like me to:
1. **Create the database tables** and implement persistence?
2. **Implement real analytics** calculations?
3. **Build the PDF export** feature?
4. **Something else?**
