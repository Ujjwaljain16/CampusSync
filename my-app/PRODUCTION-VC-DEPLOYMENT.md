# Production VC Deployment Guide

## üöÄ When to Implement Production Key Generation

### Current Status: Development Ready ‚úÖ
- **Safe for development and testing**
- **All features work perfectly**
- **Ready for demo and proof-of-concept**

### Production Deployment Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Development/Testing (Current) - Use simple keys
- **Phase 2**: Staging/Pre-production - Generate production keys
- **Phase 3**: Production Launch - Deploy with secure key management

## üîê Production Key Generation

### Step 1: Generate Production Keys
```bash
# Generate cryptographically secure keys
node scripts/generate-production-keys.js
```

This will create:
- RSA-2048 key pair
- Unique key ID
- Encrypted key storage
- Environment variable configuration

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables
Add to your production `.env`:
```bash
VC_ISSUER_JWK='{"kty":"RSA","use":"sig","kid":"prod-key-abc123",...}'
NEXT_PUBLIC_ISSUER_DID=did:web:yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ISSUER_VERIFICATION_METHOD=did:web:yourdomain.com#prod-key-abc123
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Production
1. Update production environment variables
2. Deploy the application
3. Test credential issuance
4. Verify credential verification

## üîÑ Key Rotation Strategy

### Automatic Rotation (Recommended)
```bash
# Rotate keys every 90 days
node scripts/rotate-production-keys.js
```

### Key Rotation Benefits
- **Enhanced Security**: Regular key updates
- **Backward Compatibility**: Old keys still verify existing credentials
- **Forward Security**: New credentials use latest keys
- **Audit Trail**: Complete key history tracking

## üõ°Ô∏è Production Security Checklist

### Key Management
- [ ] Use RSA-2048 or higher key size
- [ ] Store private keys securely (HSM recommended)
- [ ] Never commit private keys to version control
- [ ] Implement key rotation schedule
- [ ] Backup keys securely

### Environment Security
- [ ] Use environment variables for keys
- [ ] Secure production environment access
- [ ] Monitor key usage and access
- [ ] Implement audit logging

### Credential Security
- [ ] Validate all input data
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity
- [ ] Regular security audits

## üìä Production Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Credential issuance success rate
- Verification performance
- Key rotation status
- Security incidents
- System performance

### Alerts to Set Up
- Failed credential issuances
- Unusual verification patterns
- Key rotation failures
- Security violations

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Key Compromise
1. Immediately rotate keys
2. Revoke compromised credentials
3. Notify affected users
4. Investigate breach scope
5. Update security measures

### System Recovery
1. Restore from secure backups
2. Verify key integrity
3. Test credential verification
4. Monitor for issues
5. Document incident

## üîß Advanced Production Setup

### Hardware Security Module (HSM)
For maximum security, consider using an HSM:
- AWS CloudHSM
- Azure Key Vault
- Google Cloud KMS
- On-premises HSM

### Key Management Service
- AWS KMS
- Azure Key Vault
- HashiCorp Vault
- Custom key management solution

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### High Availability
- Multiple key instances
- Load balancing
- Failover mechanisms
- Backup systems

### Performance
- Key caching
- Batch operations
- CDN for public keys
- Database optimization

## üéØ Production Readiness Checklist

## üöÄ Go-Live Checklist

### Pre-Launch
- [ ] Production keys generated and tested
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Security testing completed
- [ ] Performance testing done
- [ ] Monitoring systems active

### Launch Day
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Verify all systems working
- [ ] Monitor for issues
- [ ] Test credential issuance
- [ ] Verify credential verification

### Post-Launch
- [ ] Monitor system performance
- [ ] Review security logs
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Plan next improvements
- [ ] Schedule regular maintenance

## üìû Support

For production deployment support:
- Review this guide thoroughly
- Test in staging environment first
- Monitor system closely after deployment
- Have rollback plan ready
- Keep security team informed

**Remember**: The current development system works perfectly for testing and demos. Production key generation is only needed when you're ready to go live with real users and real certificates.
