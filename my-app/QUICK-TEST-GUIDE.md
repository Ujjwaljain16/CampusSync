# 🎯 Quick Start Guide: Test New Features

## ✅ Three Features Implemented

### 1. **Real Analytics** - No more 0s!
### 2. **PDF Export** - Download talent reports
### 3. **Contact Tracking** - Log emails and responses

---

## 🚀 Quick Test (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Check Analytics (1 min)
```bash
# Open recruiter dashboard
http://localhost:3000/recruiter/dashboard

# Look at the 4 stat cards at the top:
# ✅ Talent Pool: Should show actual student count (e.g., 1)
# ✅ Contacted: Shows how many students you've emailed (0 initially)
# ✅ Engagement Rate: % of students in your pipeline
# ✅ Response Rate: % who responded to your emails
```

**Expected Result**: Numbers should NOT be all 0s. Talent Pool should show real count.

---

### Step 2: Test PDF Export (1 min)
```bash
# 1. In grid view, check the checkbox on any student card
# 2. Click "Export PDF" button in top-right toolbar
# 3. PDF file downloads automatically
# 4. Open PDF - should show professional report with:
#    - Student name, university, major
#    - Verified certifications count
#    - Pipeline stage, favorite status
```

**Expected Result**: PDF downloads with selected students in table format.

---

### Step 3: Test Contact Tracking (3 min)
```bash
# 1. Click the purple MAIL icon on any student card
#    ✅ Email client opens with pre-filled template
#    ✅ Contact is logged automatically in database

# 2. Click the gray CLOCK icon on the same student
#    ✅ Modal opens showing "Contact History"
#    ✅ Should see the contact you just made with timestamp

# 3. In the modal, click "Mark as Responded" button
#    ✅ Button changes to green "✓ Responded" badge
#    ✅ Response timestamp is recorded

# 4. Close modal and check top stats
#    ✅ "Contacted" increased to 1
#    ✅ "Response Rate" shows 100%

# 5. Click CLOCK icon again
#    ✅ History shows "Responded on [date]" in green
```

**Expected Result**: Full contact tracking with timestamps and response status.

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### "Analytics still showing 0s"
```bash
# Check browser console (F12)
# Look for errors in Network tab
# Verify you're logged in as recruiter
```

### "PDF export not working"
```bash
# Check that students are selected (checkbox)
# Look for errors in console
# Try selecting fewer students
```

### "Contact not logging"
```bash
# Check Network tab for POST to /api/recruiter/contacts
# Verify you clicked the Mail icon (not somewhere else)
# Refresh page and try again
```

---

## 📊 Database Check

To verify contact tracking is working:
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
SELECT 
  c.contacted_at,
  c.method,
  c.response_received,
  c.notes,
  p.full_name as student_name
FROM recruiter_contacts c
JOIN profiles p ON c.student_id = p.id
ORDER BY c.contacted_at DESC;
```

Should show your test contact with:
- `contacted_at`: Timestamp when you clicked Mail icon
- `method`: 'email'
- `response_received`: true (if you marked as responded)
- `notes`: Auto-generated note about email sent
