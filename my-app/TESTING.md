## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Test Configuration

The test suites use the following configuration:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  baseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
  testUser: {
    email: 'test@example.com',
    password: 'testpassword123'
  },
  adminUser: {
    email: 'jainujjwal1609@gmail.com',
    password: 'adminpassword123'
  },
  testCertificate: {
    title: 'Test Certificate',
    institution: 'Test University',
    date_issued: new Date().toISOString(),
    description: 'Test certificate for verification testing'
  }
};
```

### Database Setup

Ensure the following database migrations are applied:

1. `001_create_user_roles.sql` - User role management
2. `002_fix_user_roles_policies.sql` - RLS policy fixes
3. `003_disable_rls_temporarily.sql` - Temporary RLS disable
4. `004_enable_pgcrypto.sql` - Cryptographic functions
5. `005_add_verification_tables.sql` - Verification engine tables
6. `006_fix_user_role_trigger.sql` - User role triggers
7. `007_disable_user_roles_rls.sql` - RLS configuration
8. `008_create_get_user_role_function.sql` - Role functions
9. `009_harden_assign_default_role.sql` - Role assignment hardening
10. `010_assign_default_role_exception_guard.sql` - Exception handling
11. `011_add_vc_revocation.sql` - VC revocation support

### Trusted Issuers Setup

Run the trusted issuers seeding script:

```bash
node scripts/seed-trusted-issuers.js
```

This will populate the database with common certificate issuers like Coursera, edX, Udemy, etc.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Server Not Running
```
‚ùå Server is not running. Some tests may fail.
```
**Solution:** Start the development server with `npm run dev`

#### 2. Database Connection Issues
```
‚ùå Database connection failed
```
**Solution:** Check your Supabase configuration and ensure the database is accessible

#### 3. Authentication Failures
```
‚ùå Authentication tests failed
```
**Solution:** Verify your Supabase auth configuration and test user credentials

#### 4. File Upload Issues
```
‚ùå File upload failed
```
**Solution:** Ensure the Supabase storage bucket is created and configured

#### 5. Verification Engine Failures
```
‚ùå Verification engine tests failed
```
**Solution:** Check that all required dependencies are installed and trusted issuers are seeded

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:

```bash
DEBUG=true node test-runner.js
```

### Test Reports

Test results are saved to:

- `test-summary.json` - Overall test summary
- `test-report.json` - Detailed comprehensive test results
- `verification-engine-test-report.json` - Verification engine test results

## üìà Performance Expectations

### Response Times
- API calls should complete within 5 seconds
- Verification engine should process certificates within 10 seconds
- Database queries should be optimized with proper indexes

### Success Rates
- Authentication: 100%
- Certificate Management: 95%+
- Verification Engine: 90%+ (depends on test data quality)
- Verifiable Credentials: 100%
- Public APIs: 100%

### Memory Usage
- Application should not have memory leaks
- Test suite should complete without excessive memory usage

## üîí Security Considerations

The test suite validates:

- **Authentication Security** - Proper user authentication
- **Authorization Security** - Role-based access control
- **Input Validation** - All API endpoints validate input
- **SQL Injection Prevention** - Database queries are protected
- **XSS Prevention** - User input is sanitized
- **CSRF Protection** - API endpoints are protected
- **JWT/JWS Security** - Tokens are properly signed and validated

## ü§ù Contributing

### Adding New Tests

1. Create test functions following the existing pattern
2. Use the `assert()` function for test assertions
3. Add appropriate logging with `log()`
4. Update the test runner if needed

### Test Structure

```javascript
class NewFeatureTests {
  static async run() {
    log('üîß Running New Feature Tests...');
    
    try {
      // Test 1: Basic functionality
      const result = await makeRequest('/api/new-feature');
      assert(result.success, 'New feature should work');
      
      // Test 2: Error handling
      const errorResult = await makeRequest('/api/new-feature/invalid');
      assert(!errorResult.success, 'Should handle errors gracefully');
      
    } catch (error) {
      assert(false, `New feature tests failed: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Test Independence** - Each test should be independent
2. **Clear Assertions** - Use descriptive assertion messages
3. **Error Handling** - Test both success and failure cases
4. **Performance** - Consider test execution time
5. **Documentation** - Document test expectations

## üìû Support

For issues or questions about testing:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review the test reports for specific failures
3. Verify your environment configuration
4. Check the application logs for errors
